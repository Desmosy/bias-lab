# The Bias Lab - Process Documentation

## Design Philosophy

This prototype follows the "ship beats perfect" principle, prioritizing a working, shippable product that demonstrates core value. The design is heavily inspired by the clean, minimalist aesthetic of OpenAI and Anthropic blogs, focusing on readability, accessibility, and intuitive navigation.

## Key Design Decisions

### Backend Architecture (FastAPI)
- **Framework Choice**: FastAPI for automatic validation, fast development, and excellent documentation
- **Mock Data Strategy**: Structured mock data that mirrors real bias scores with 5 dimensions
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints following standard conventions
- **CORS Configuration**: Environment-configurable for production security
- **Health Endpoint**: Added for deployment monitoring and load balancer health checks

### Frontend Architecture (React + TypeScript + Tailwind)
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript for type safety and maintainability
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for rapid, consistent styling
- **Font**: Inter font family for professional, readable typography
- **Color Palette**: Minimal, accessible colors with proper dark mode support
- **Component Strategy**: Reusable, composable components with clear separation of concerns

### UI/UX Principles
1. **Minimalism**: Clean lines, generous whitespace, restrained color palette
2. **Typography Hierarchy**: Clear h1/h2/p hierarchy matching modern blog standards
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Skeleton loading states, hover effects, smooth transitions
4. **Accessibility**: Proper semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, color contrast
5. **Mobile-First**: Responsive design that works on all screen sizes

## Technical Implementation

### Navigation & Information Architecture
- **Homepage**: Card-based narrative clusters with clear visual hierarchy
- **Article View**: Two-column layout with content + analysis sidebar
- **Navigation**: Contextual back links, breadcrumbs in header
- **Loading States**: Skeleton animations for better perceived performance

### Bias Visualization
- **Radar Chart**: Custom SVG implementation for bias dimensions
- **Color Coding**: Consistent color scheme across highlights and charts
- **Interactive Highlights**: Hover tooltips with detailed bias explanations
- **Progress Bars**: Alternative bias score visualization with traffic-light colors

### Data Structure
```typescript
// Five bias dimensions as specified in requirements
BiasScores {
  ideological_stance: 0.0-1.0
  factual_grounding: 0.0-1.0
  framing_choices: 0.0-1.0
  emotional_tone: 0.0-1.0
  source_transparency: 0.0-1.0
}
```

## Mock Data Strategy

The mock data is designed to be realistic and demonstrate the full range of bias detection:
- **12 articles** across 5 different sources
- **3 narrative clusters** with varying divergence indices
- **Text highlights** covering all 5 bias dimensions
- **Primary sources** for transparency and fact-checking
- **Realistic content** that could plausibly come from news articles

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Bundle Size**: Minimal dependencies, custom SVG charts instead of heavy chart libraries
2. **Loading Strategy**: Skeleton states, progressive image loading
3. **API Design**: Efficient data structure, proper HTTP status codes
4. **CSS**: Tailwind purging, minimal custom CSS
5. **React**: useMemo for expensive calculations, proper dependency arrays

## Deployment Strategy

### Backend (Render/Railway/Heroku)
- Environment variables for CORS configuration
- Health endpoint for monitoring
- Procfile for easy deployment
- Requirements.txt with locked versions

### Frontend (Vercel/Netlify)
- Static site generation
- Environment variable for API URL
- SPA redirects for client-side routing
- Optimized build with tree shaking

## Accessibility Features

- Semantic HTML structure
- Proper heading hierarchy
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader friendly
- High contrast colors
- Focus indicators
- Alternative text where needed

## Future Enhancements

1. **Bias Over Time**: Line chart component for temporal analysis (already created)
2. **Search & Filtering**: Find articles by source, date, or bias score
3. **Comparative Analysis**: Side-by-side article comparison
4. **User Preferences**: Save favorite articles, bias dimension weights
5. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live bias analysis
6. **Export Features**: PDF reports, data export
7. **Advanced Analytics**: Trend analysis, source reliability scoring

## AI Tool Usage

This project leveraged AI assistance for:
- Code generation and refactoring
- UI/UX design decisions
- Mock data creation
- Component architecture planning
- Documentation writing

All AI-generated code was reviewed, tested, and customized to meet specific requirements.

## Trade-offs Made

1. **Custom Charts vs Libraries**: Chose custom SVG for smaller bundle size and exact control
2. **Mock Data vs Real API**: Mock data for faster development and demonstration
3. **Component Complexity**: Balanced reusability with simplicity
4. **Feature Scope**: Focused on core MVP features over advanced analytics
5. **Browser Support**: Modern browsers only for smaller polyfill bundle

## Validation & Testing

- Manual testing across Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- Mobile responsiveness testing
- Dark mode functionality
- API endpoint validation
- Loading state verification
- Error handling confirmation

This prototype successfully demonstrates the core value proposition: making media bias tangible, visceral, and accessible through clean, intuitive interfaces.
